        Summary: An epic account of the struggle between good and evil, the film chronicles the epic adventure of Frodo Baggins, a peaceful 
        Hobbit who has to take on a tremendous responsibility. What Frodo must do is plunge into the realm of the Cracks of the Apocalypse to 
        engage in an epic struggle and destroy this ring forever. Fortunately, he will not embark on this arduous journey alone: alongside Gandalf,
         Legolas, an elf, Gimli the dwarf; Aragorn the scout, the warrior Boromir, and Frodo's three friends, Merry, Pippin, and Samwise, who are 
         also Hobbit like himself, come with him. This group advances through mountains, forests, snow, castles, rivers and plains, battling 
         against the evil forces they encounter. By fulfilling the task of destroying the Ring, their goal is to erase the Dark Lords' reign 
         from their reality.
