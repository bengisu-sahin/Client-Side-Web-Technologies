### Project 1
#### Problem 1: Implement a simple Log-in Page
In this problem, you are asked to implement a login page similar to the one shown below (name your file login.html):

The login page must be inside a container with a width of 400px centered in the middle of the screen. Notice that the container has a box-shadow around its right and bottom edges. It has a title named “Login” centered on the container. Below the Login title, we have 3 circular buttons with titles “G”, “f”, “in” representing login with Google, facebook and Linked-in. Each of these buttons is 40x40 pixels. Under the buttons, we have two input fields, one for email and one for password. At the bottom, we have the “Submit” button. The two input fields and the Submit button must be placed inside a HTML form. Notice that both of the input fields and the submit button must extend the full width of the container (100%).
All of the buttons must have “hover” effects as shown below:
       
On the left, the cursor is on top of the “f” button and on the right, the cursor is on top of the “Submit” button. In both cases, the cursor turns to “pointer”, the background color turns to “green” and the text color turns to “white”. You must write the necessary CSS rules that make this possible.
